    <p>I’m Cameron Havlish, I am a sound design student at Michigan State University
         where I am part of the game design minor. Like most of us on this site, 
         I have been an avid gamer since I was young, first playing on the Nintendo 
         Gamecube and have since played countless games that has led to wanting to pursue
          the career path I am in now. I mainly play FPS games but have been known to 
          enjoy RPG’s. Outside of gaming, I am a metal head and spend much of my time
           listening to anything and everything metal, I am also a huge car nerd which 
           if you are interested in seeing the stuff I have worked on just click
